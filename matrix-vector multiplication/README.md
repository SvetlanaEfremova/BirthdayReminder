The program implements the multiplication of a vector by a matrix.
We have a four-component vector b represented by an array, and a 4 Ã— 4 matrix a represented by a two-dimensional array. Their product will be a new four-element vector c. Its components will be the sum of the products of the element of the vector b and the row of the matrix a.
All inputs, matrix a and vector b are from user input.
The program calculates the resulting vector in accordance with the formula for multiplying a matrix by a vector.
